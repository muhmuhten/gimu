## gimu

Configuration via [ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/) for my
personal servers, generally only tested against a recent CoreOS beta or major
Fedora release; that's just what runs my servers.

Subdirectories under `play/` indicate the subset of hosts the playbook is
tested with and run against, which often but does not necessarily coincide with
their `hosts` fields.
